                <p>Coffee is a beverage made by brewing coffee beans that have been roasted and ground into powder. Coffee is a commodity in the world that is cultivated in more than 50 countries. </br>
                    Two species of coffee trees that are generally known are Robusta Coffee (Coffea canephora) and Arabica Coffee (Coffea arabica).
                    The processing of coffee before it can be drunk goes through a long process, namely from harvesting coffee beans that have been ripe either by machine or by hand. Then the coffee beans are processed and dried before they become coffee beans. The next process is roasting with varying degrees. After roasting, the coffee beans are ground or ground into coffee grounds before the coffee can be drunk.</p>
                <p>History records that the discovery of coffee as a nutritious and energy drink was first discovered by the Ethiopians on the African Continent around 3000 years (1000 BC) ago.
                    Coffee then continued to develop until now it has become one of the most popular drinks in the world which is consumed by various groups of people.[citation needed] Indonesia itself has been able to produce more than 400 thousand tons of coffee per year.
                    Besides its attractive taste and aroma, coffee can also reduce the risk of developing cancer, diabetes, gallstones, and various heart (cardiovascular) diseases.</p>

                <p>Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. It was here where ReagenCoffe opened its first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices from around the world for our customers to take home. Our name was inspired by the classic tale, “Moby-Dick,” evoking the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.</p>
                <p>Ten years later, a young New Yorker named Howard Schultz would walk through these doors and become captivated with ReagenCoffe coffee from his first sip. After joining the company in 1982, a different cobblestone road would lead him to another discovery. It was on a trip to Milan in 1983 that Howard first experienced Italy’s coffeehouses, and he returned to Seattle inspired to bring the warmth and artistry of its coffee culture to ReagenCoffe. By 1987, we swapped our brown aprons for green ones and embarked on our next chapter as a coffeehouse.</p>
                <p>ReagenCoffe would soon expand to Chicago and Vancouver, Canada and then on to California, Washington, D.C. and New York. By 1996, we would cross the Pacific to open our first store in Japan, followed by Europe in 1998 and China in 1999. Over the next two decades, we would grow to welcome millions of customers each week and become a part of the fabric of tens of thousands of neighborhoods all around the world. In everything we do, we are always dedicated to Our Mission: to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.</p></div>
